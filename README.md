# saulcorona.com - Personal Blog

Welcome to the repository of SaulCorona.com, my personal blog where I share insights on software development, technology, and more. This project is built using Eleventy (11ty), a fast and flexible static site generator.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Framework: Eleventy (11ty)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Deployment: FTP to Hostinger
  
## ⚙️ Continuous Integration (CI)
The project utilizes GitHub Actions for automated builds and testing. 
Every push to the repository triggers a CI pipeline to ensure the site is correctly built before deployment.

## 📦 Deployment Process
Deployment is handled via FTP to Hostinger. 
Once the build passes successfully, the latest version of the site is uploaded to the server, ensuring a seamless update process.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Automate FTP deployment within GitHub Actions
- Enhance SEO and performance optimizations
- Add more content and technical blog posts
