Hey everyone! Today, I want to share my productivity setup on my phone and computer.

Itâ€™s designed to help me stay focused, minimize distractions, and make the most of my time. Hereâ€™s how I do it:

## Grayscale Mode: Less Color, More Focus

I use the **Color Filter** feature on iPhone, activated through a custom shortcut. [Hereâ€™s the link to the shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/078a87e96db140459898224e89bd8161).

### What It Does:

This shortcut instantly switches my iPhone screen to black and white.

### Why Grayscale Mode?

- **Reduction of Distractions:** Without vibrant colors, apps are less enticing, helping to curb compulsive social media scrolling and unnecessary app usage.

- **Improved Focus:** By removing the attention-grabbing effect of bright colors, itâ€™s easier to concentrate on the content Iâ€™m working on.

- **Eye Comfort:** Grayscale reduces visual stimuli and contrast, which is easier on the eyes, helping to alleviate digital eye strain and headaches.

## Work Mode: Maximum Focus During Office Hours

Through the **Automation** feature in the Shortcuts app, Iâ€™ve configured my phone to automatically enable Grayscale Mode when **Work Mode** is active. This is set from **Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.**

### How It Works:

- **Notifications Silenced:** Almost all notifications are turned off, except for essential work apps. (I generally keep notifications disabled, except for important apps like banking or family messaging.)

- **Minimalist Home Screen:** My main screen is customized to display only the apps I need for work, removing any distractions.

### Benefits of Work Mode:

- **Fewer Distractions:** By silencing notifications, I avoid constant interruptions that break my focus and reduce productivity.

- **Better Time Management:** Without the temptation of alerts, I can manage my time more effectively, maintaining a healthier work-life balance.

- **Reduced Stress:** Turning off non-essential notifications helps lower stress and anxiety, allowing for better mental well-being.

## No Social Media: Regaining Control of My Time

I used to spend over **4 hours per day** on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and I always had YouTube playing in the background. It was overwhelming and unproductive. Hereâ€™s how I changed that:

### What I Did:

- **Deleted Social Media Apps** from my phone.

- Installed the [**Freedom App**](https://freedom.to/) (Iphone and Macbook), which blocks apps and websites. It functions like a VPN, effectively cutting off digital distractions on both my phone and computer.

### The Results:

- I now spend less than **30 minutes per day** on social media, mainly for responding to messages or occasionally posting. After that, I close the apps immediately.

- **Improved Sleep:** No more late-night scrolling.

- **Healthier Lifestyle:** More time for the gym, reading, movies, and anime.

- **Enhanced Focus:** Greater mental clarity and energy throughout the day.

## Final Thoughts: A Radical but Rewarding Change

I know this setup might seem extreme, but it has significantly improved my productivity, focus, and overall well-being. I feel happier and more energized with these changes.
